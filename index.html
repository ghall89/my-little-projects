		<h1>My Little Projects</h1>
		<p>My name is Graham, and I'm a front-end web developer.</p>
		<p>
			In January 2021, at the age of 31, I started my web development journey
			with a full stack web development boot camp with UC Berkeley, and I
			immediately fell in love with building cool things. Since then, I've been
			building these little projects to practice my skills and become a better
			developer.
