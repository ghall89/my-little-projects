		<h1>My Little Projects</h1>
		<div>
			<p>Hi! 👋 My name is Graham, and I'm a front-end web developer.</p>
			<p>
				In 📆 January 2021, at the age of 31, I started my web development
				journey with a full stack web development boot camp through UC Berkeley,
				and I immediately fell in love with 🔨 building cool things. Since then,
				I've been building these little projects to 👨‍💻 practice my skills and
				become a better developer.

				building cool things that much more enjoyable.
